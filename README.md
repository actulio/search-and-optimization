# Search and Optimization

This repository is just a collection of algorithms that I had to implement for a discipline in my master's degree. This is not a library or anything like it. This is just for personal reference. Most of the algorithms here were based off [Essential of Metaheuristics](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/).

# How to run

To run it, do:

```
node NAME_OF_THE_FILE.js
```

Or hit `ctrl + alt + r` if you use vscode. A task runner is configured in [tasks.json](/src/.vscode/tasks.json) and the key binding in [keybindings.json](/src/.vscode/keybindings.json).
